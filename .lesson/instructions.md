# Challenge 3.1 - DrawingPanel Animation

You will find the full instructions and grading details for this optional Challenge assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clbjpqUL_wJAMmI72Tnyri-8rrx8wO-HYHmIdHJadOU/edit?usp=sharing). Write your animation code into the `Animation.java` file that has been provided for you in this project.

## Technical Notes

* If you can't see your full DrawingPanel screen, even when you've
  made Replit's output area as large as possible: Zoom out in your
  browser (ctrl-minus)
* If your display in Replit shows up weird (e.g. DrawingPanel squished
  into a narrow horizontal space between Console and code): Refresh this
  page in your browser

**Have fun! ^_^**
